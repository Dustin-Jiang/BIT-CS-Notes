# My Story with Science and Technology

Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by science and technology. I remember watching documentaries about space exploration, artificial intelligence, and computer technology with awe and curiosity. I wanted to learn more about how these fields work and what they can do for humanity.

I was drawn to computers and programming since my parent bought the first family computer when I was 5 years old, when they taught me how to surf the Internet and chat online with friends. I got my first second-handed laptop from my dad at my 12's and I immediately started to learn how to code online. I enjoyed creating tools, apps, and websites using different languages and tools, learned to optimize the operating system for a better using experience on that outdated old laptop, and I liked the challenge of solving problems and the satisfaction of seeing my creations come to life.

As I grew older, I realized that computer science is not only a hobby, but also a powerful tool for innovation and discovery. Computer science not only can help us understand complex phenomena, design efficient systems, and improve our lives in various ways, but also connects us with other disciplines and domains, such as mathematics, physics, biology, engineering, arts, and humanities.

That is why I chose to study computer science at BIT. BIT is one of the leading institutions for research and education in science and technology domestically, having a rich history of breakthroughs and achievements in computer science. BIT also has a vibrant community of faculty, students, and alumni who share a passion for learning, exploring, and creating.

At BIT, I hope to learn from the best minds in computer science and to contribute to the advancement of the field. I am interested in pursuing topics such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, cybersecurity, and human-computer interaction. I also want to explore the interdisciplinary connections between computer science and other fields, such as astronomy, neuroscience, music, and philosophy.

I believe that studying computer science at BIT will enable me to pursue my dreams and goals. I want to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world. I want to create solutions that can help people overcome challenges, enhance well-being, and achieve happiness. I want to be part of the future of science and technology.
